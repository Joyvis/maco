# Life Planner App - Project Plan

## Overview
A life assistant app that collects data from different life areas (finances, sleep, nutrition, exercise, etc.) and uses analytics tools (e.g., Databricks) to provide insights.

## Project Structure
Version-specific documentation is organized in the `docs/` folder:
- `docs/mvp/` - MVP documentation (see [[docs/mvp/README.md]] for details)
- `docs/v1/` - v1 documentation
- `docs/v2/` - v2 documentation
- (and so on for future versions)

## Planning Approach

1. Break down problems gradually through conversation
2. Split general idea into epics, then refine each epic individually
3. Avoid comprehensive upfront planning
4. Document decisions with rationale (question → answer → solution → documentation)

## Documentation Requirements

- **Format**: Markdown files following Obsidian structure (files that link to other files)
- **Structure**: Similar to Jira tickets (Epics, user stories, dependencies)
- **Process**: Document decision-making process to understand why choices were made
- **Location**: All documentation (epics, user stories, etc.) stored in `docs/` folder

## Versioning Plan

Track project evolution through versioned releases:

- **MVP**: Initial release with core financial features
- **v1, v2, etc.**: Subsequent releases with new features and improvements

For each version, document:
- Changes introduced
- Decision-making process (questions, answers, rationale)
- Migration notes (if applicable)

Version documentation structure:
- `docs/mvp/` - All MVP-related documentation
- `docs/v1/` - All v1-related documentation
- `docs/v2/` - All v2-related documentation
- (and so on for future versions)

## Workflow Instructions

1. Do not document or implement anything before explicit authorization
2. When documenting, include the decision-making process (questions asked, answers given, solution defined)
3. Break large problems into small pieces iteratively through conversation
4. Store all documentation in the `docs/` folder structure
